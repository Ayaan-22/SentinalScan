## 🚀 Overview

**SentinalScan** is a powerful, production-ready web vulnerability scanner designed for security professionals and developers. It automates the detection of common web vulnerabilities, providing real-time feedback and detailed reports.

The project features a **Premium Cyber/Glassmorphism Interface** built with React & Tailwind CSS. It provides a hacker-style dashboard with real-time logs, animated stats, and deep insight into security posture.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Premium Cyber UI**: Dark-mode "Glassmorphism" aesthetic with neon accents, smooth animations, and responsive layout.
- **🔍 Comprehensive Crawling**: Intelligent multi-threaded crawler with scope control and `robots.txt` compliance.
- **⚡ Real-Time Scanning**: View live execution logs and findings via WebSocket streams.
- **🖥️ Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Live "Hacker Terminal" logs.
  - Animated statistics cards.
  - Severity-coded finding badges (Critical/High/Medium/Low).
- **📊 Multiple Report Formats**: Export findings to **HTML**, **JSON**, and **Text**.

### Vulnerability Checks

SentinalScan actively tests for:

- **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Error-based and Time-based detection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected XSS payload testing.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Missing token detection on forms.
- **Security Headers**: Missing `HSTS`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`.
- **Sensitive File Exposure**: Detection of `.env`, `.git`, backups, and config files.
- **Clickjacking**: Missing `X-Frame-Options` or CSP frame ancestors.
- **Cookie Security**: Missing `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.
- **Open Redirects** & **Path Traversal**.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+ & npm

### 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the project root:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install Node modules
npm install
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Option A: Modern Web Application (Recommended)

1.  **Start the Backend API**:

    ```bash
    # From project root
    python backend/api.py
    ```

    _Server runs at http://localhost:8000_

2.  **Start the Frontend**:

    ```bash
    # From frontend/ directory
    npm run dev
    ```

    _Client runs at http://localhost:5173_

3.  Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser.
4.  Enter a Target URL and click **Initialize Scan**.

### Option B: Command Line Interface (CLI)

For quick, headless scans:

```bash
# Basic scan
python backend/vuln_scanner.py -u https://example.com

# Advanced usage
python backend/vuln_scanner.py -u https://example.com --max-pages 100 --workers 10 --no-verify-ssl
```

### Option C: Legacy GUI

To run the standalone desktop version (Tkinter):

```bash
python vuln_gui.py
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize scans via the UI (Advanced Settings accordion) or CLI arguments:

- **Max Pages**: Limit the crawl depth and breadth.
- **Concurrency**: Number of worker threads.
- **Delays**: Throttling requests to avoid WAF blocking.
- **Auth**: Bearer tokens and custom cookies support.
- **Exclusions**: Skip specific paths like `/logout` or `/admin`.
